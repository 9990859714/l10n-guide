About locales
*************

Locales are definition files that tell a computer about the cultural
conventions of a language and/or country.  So a locale will define how
characters are sorted, how the date and time are represented, the names of the
days of the week and months of the year.

These are the locale files that interest a localiser:

  * glibc
  * ICU
  * OpenOffice.org
  * CLDR

To help with defining locale data you will also need to know about:

  * Character sort orders (collation)

The CLDR is a unification of the various locale information that uses  the `locale data markup language specification <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/>`_.  The CLDR is an important project to contribute your locale data to as this will eventually become the authoritative repository for locale information.
