Setting Project Objectives
**************************

What are the aims of your project?  Without that defined you are bound to
wander aimlessly and might be surprised when what you thought were your
objectives are not being met.

Some misguided objectives
=========================

It is always useful to look at some poorly formulated objectives and work from
there.  So here are some examples:

Disconnected from reality
-------------------------

"Our goal is to ensure that people who speak Eastern Blowfish can use computers
in their mother tongue".  The Eastern Blowfish team then decides to localise
GNOME.  However, the reality in West Smedburg is that people use Windows and
end-users have not adopted Linux in any great numbers.  The result is an effort
to localise which will probably be successful at localisation but not at
impacting the lives of the stated users as they are all still battling away in
English on Windows.

A real world example.  The Translate.org.za project initially selected the
:doc:`kde_desktop` as its first localisation project.  The goal was a little
more defined in that we hoped to impact users at the same time as promoting
Linux.  When we readjusted our objectives we realised that if we wanted to
impact language speakers then we would have to be localising cross-platform
projects such as :doc:`openoffice.org` and :doc:`mozilla`.  Thus our objectives
have shifted.

Another example is that of a localiser who I met who reiterated the Eastern
Blowfish example but for a real language, his mother tongue.  However, on
challenging him it turned out he was his family's computer guru.  He wanted
them to use computers in their mother tongue.  So really his objective was: "I
want to localise so that my mother can email using GNOME in her mother tongue".
This is a perfectly valid goal -- just don't confuse it by saying your doing it
for everyone.

"I translated my Linux distribution's installer because that is where people
start." The truth is that most computer users don't install their own operating
systems, and that such installation is only done on occasion. Translating
software that people use daily will have much more of an impact.
