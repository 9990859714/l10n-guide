Thunderbird
***********

Thunderbird is the e-mail client that was born out of the :doc:`mozilla`
project.

This page contains Thunderbird-specific localisation notes and issues. You
should read this in conjunction with the :doc:`mozilla` pages as there are some
things shared between Thunderbird and :doc:`firefox` localisation.

As stated on the :doc:`mozilla` page, there are more complete instructions
about the requirements and processes involved in Mozilla localisation on the
`Mozilla L10n <https://wiki.mozilla.org/l10n/home_page>`_ project page.
