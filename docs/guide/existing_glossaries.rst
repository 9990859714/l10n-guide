Existing Glossary Resources
***************************

The following are existing glossary resources.  Please first check that you are
indeed allowed to use them.

For Free and Open Source Software, the single most useful resource is probably
at http://open-tran.eu/  which allows you to view translations from many of the
major FOSS applications. Support for Open-Tran.eu is integrated into some
translation tools, such as `Virtaal <http://virtaal.translatehouse.org>`_.

The FUEL project tries to coordinate terminology development amongst Indic
languages.
