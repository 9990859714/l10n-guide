PrepTags
********

PrepTags is a file preparation software which allows to prepare files for
translation in most CAT tools. Export formats include tagged RTF (Wordfast, DV,
Trados, MemoQ), ttx (native TagEditor format), XLIFF (Virtaal, OmegaT,
Heartsome...), TXML (native format for Wordfast Pro) and text (simplified
tagged RTF format.

Files are prepared by defining a taglist, which is essentially a list of
regular expressions enhanced with tagging features. This allows for the
preparation of almost any text-based format, including XML, php, asp, po
files..., even if they do not follow the standard rules of the format.
