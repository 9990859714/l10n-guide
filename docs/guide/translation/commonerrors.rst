Common Translation Errors
*************************

Translators - even professional translators - usually make these error when
translating computer software.

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#overview_of_common_errors:

Overview of common errors
=========================

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#capitalisation:

Capitalisation
--------------

| **Wrong**: no capitalisation in translation
| **Correct**: translation follows translation language capitalisation convention

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#double_words:

Double words
------------

*Translator could not decide which word was more appropriate*

| **Wrong**: two translated words for one original word
| **Correct**: choose one word if you have two options

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#translated_things_that_should_stay_in_english:

Translated things that should stay in English
---------------------------------------------

| **Wrong**: translating program function name like get_file_attributes()
| **Correct**: leave program syntax or function names untranslated

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#variables:

Variables
---------

| **Wrong**: variables left out of translation
| **Correct**: variable in translation in the correct order for the language

| **Wrong**: environment variable names (eg. EDITOR) and possible fixed values (eg. COLOR, TRANSPARENT) translated
| **Correct**: left in English and perhaps surrounded by single quotes to indicate that they are not in the target language on purpose.

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#punctuation:

Punctuation
-----------

| **Wrong**: leaving out end punctuation and whitespace (eg. ``"File: "``)
| **Correct**: copying end punctuation and whitespace almost exactly as the original into the translation.

| **Wrong**: adding missing fullstops to translated sentence
| **Correct**: if full sentences do not contain a fullstop in the original do not add one to the translation.

| **Wrong**: adding exclamation marks (!) to the translation when they occur in the original
| **Correct**: use exclamation marks to correspond with the tone of the application and the convention of the translated language.  Ie you may leave them out of the translation.

| **Wrong**: leaving out ellipses (...)
| **Correct**: always add ellipses to the translation

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#accelerators:

Accelerators
------------

| **Wrong**: leaving out accelerators (either _&~ depending on the application)
| **Correct**: if the original has an accelerator so should the translation

| **Wrong**: placing the accelerator exactly in the same position as the original
| **Correct**: place the accelerator on the word / syllable / part of the sentence
that is accented in its pronunciation or is the focus of the sentence.

| **Wrong**: using the same letter for accelerator keys
| **Correct**: try to vary the letters chosen as the accelerator key (in some
languages almost all words start with U or I.  In this case make an effort to
choose other letters)

.. _../pages/guide/translation/commonerrors#html:

HTML
----

| **Wrong**: HTML tags are translated
| **Correct**: HTML tags are not translated

| **Wrong**: translatable HTML entities are not translated
| **Correct**: translate items that will be viewable.  E.g. HTML img tag's alt attribute <img alt="translate me">, a tag's title
attribute <a href=blah title="translate me">.
