Gettext Plural Header

.. _../pages/guide/translation_guidelines_template#english_style_text_based_plurals:

English style text based plurals
--------------------------------

English style plurals are where the text uses both the singular and plural:

  Please enter the author(s) name.
  Document(s)

In some languages if you had to use the same bracketed construct it looks ugly.  In Nguni based languages we convert such sentences to
only use the plural form, as we feel the singular is inferred and using the bracketed construct in ugly.

Punctuation
===========

.. _../pages/guide/translation_guidelines_template#french_style:

French Style

Some sentence appear with spaces before end punctuation:

We call this French style punctuation, should translators keep this style or convert it to
a normal style?
