Generating Statistics for your project
**************************************

It is always nice to track statistics for your projects.  

* `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org>`_ presents statistics for all
  hosted files
* :ref:`toolkit:pocount` can output word and string statistics
  for files (can also output to CSV files for use in a spreadsheet)
* :ref:`Czech OpenOffice.org teams stats tool
  <../pages/developers/project_statistics#czech_openoffice.org_teams_stats_tool>`

Czech OpenOffice.org teams stats tool
=====================================

This is the tool used by the Czech language team for OpenOffice.org:

* http://tmp.janik.cz/OpenOffice.org/l10n/PO2STAT
* `The current Czech stats page <http://cs.openoffice.org/stats/>`_

In the words of the author, Pavel Janik, this requires no "*database, PHP and
similar ugly stuff*"

KDE statistics pages
====================

FIXME track down the PHP scripts for this

This seems to be the original stats generation page as most others look
frighteningly similar to the KDE pages:

* http://i18n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk/index.php

.. _../pages/guide/statistics#update_24.10.2009:

UPDATE 24.10.2009
-----------------

The scripts for the KDE statistics page as seen here:

* http://i18n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/team/

Are generated using the l10n-stats scripts, which can be obtained here:

* http://i18n.kde.org/about-stats.php
