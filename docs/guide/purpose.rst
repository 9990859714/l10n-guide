Purpose
*******

The purpose of this document is to provide one reference for localisers.  You
will find lots of information on localising and packaging on the web but not a
single resource that can guide you.  Most of the information is also domain
specific ie it addresses KDE, Mozilla, etc.  We hope that this is more general.

This document also goes beyond the technical aspects of localisation which
seems to be the domain of other localisation documents.  The document aims to
help other localisation teams by consolidating the information of the
`Translate.org.za <http://translate.org.za>`_ project and other localisation
initiatives.  So in this document we have added sections on selecting what to
translate, budgeting, timing and more.

There are sections explaining how to use the `Translate Toolkit
<http://toolkit.translatehouse.org>`_ and practical sections on common
translation technical errors as well as ideas on how to translate or configure
certain things like accelerators key, whether to translate acronyms, etc.

Duplication
===========

We hope not to duplicate information and will point to other online resources
if needed.  But often we document in the process of creating our translation
builds so there might be slight duplication.
