It may be useful to provide translators with a web-based archive of reference documents that pertain to their translation.  This would help them do highly focused searches in online documentation etc.

Create a custom Google search engine
====================================

Google offers a service whereby anyone can create a specialised search engine by limiting the pages and web sites that are indexed.  The service has several additional features but for our purposes the most basic features would suffice.

  * `http://www.google.com/coop/cse/ <http://www.google.com/coop/cse/>`_

  * You must have a Google account (free registration)
  * You can change most aspects of it later, so don't worry about putting in the wrong information.
  * You can specify just one or several pages/sites to index, and you can specify them in interesting ways (eg only pages that contain the letters "about").  You can also exclude pages by a pattern.

Unfortunately, the URL of the search engine is a bit difficult to remember, but you can easily link to it from any page.

Here is a test search engine that will search only pages of this wiki, as well as pages from the Wikipedia that contain the letters "transl" in their URL:

  * `Translate Wiki Search Engine <http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=003167205026530159007%3Asrfg5ujnxog>`_ (try doing a search for "machine").
