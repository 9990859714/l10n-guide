Web-based Fonts Rendering Technologies
**************************************

This is a list of resources that list web-baed font rendering technologies for various
scripts.  The idea is that if a person does not have a font that a technique of 
either font uploading or graphical glyph substitution is used to ensure that a 
user can still see the text.

Not all of them are useful, most of them probably don't apply to you as computers
can probably render your script correctly. Some are non-Free but may give ideas to people.

Glyphgate
=========

  * http:*www.glyphgate.com/
  * http:*www.nunatsiaq.com/news/nunavut/41008_11.html
  * http://www.attavik.net

Mainly for web based rendering of languages without the need to install fonts.
In the worst case scenario it will create images of all the missing glyphs so
you can view the webpage without needing to install a font.
