Translate@thon
**************

A translate@thon is a mass translation event (also called a localization
sprint).  Get a number of translators in one room and begin translating and you
have a translate@thon.  The general idea is that translation is simply a
numbers game, get a large number of people translating and the task will be
completed more quickly.

Have you hosted a translate@thon?  Then please add your event to our
:doc:`Translate@thon hall of fame <translateathon_halloffame>`

Expectations
============

To get the most our of your Translate@thon it is important that you understand
what kind of outcomes you can expect and align your expectations accordingly.
You will get different outcomes from small and large events.

* **Large event** --- 40+ people.  Most people will be new a translating and
  most probably unskilled.  You will spend a lot of time explaining things,
  doing presentations, etc.  Some people who are there might just be there for
  the social and will disturb others reducing their output.  Expect low
  quality.
* **Small event** --- 5 people. Usually the group is dedicated.  The ratio of
  techies to translators is high so the quality goes up.  The atmosphere is one
  of hard fun work as opposed to the carnival atmosphere at a large event.

So what can you expect?

Use a small event to get work done.  Get high quality translations.  Use a
large event to expose people to localisation, to get media coverage and to
promote Free Software.  Large events are the places were you fish out the one
or two dedicated translators who will carry on.  At one large event we met with
lecturers on a translation studies degree, localisation is now being worked
into their degree.

Without a dedicated session or two devoted to review and quality assurance,
expect there to be many problems with quality. Build in review sessions as part
of your planning if you want to improve the quality and train people on the
detail needed for high quality translation. Below more issues about quality is
discussed.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#hosting_partner:

Hosting partner
===============

It might be good to involve a hosting partner.  Traditionally we have chosen
the language departments of Universities.  They have access to good skills,
computer labs and their own network of people.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#who_should_attend:

Who should attend
=================

You can take various strategies.  Either throw the door wide open in which case
you probably need to publicise the event slightly differently so that you can
attract various people.  Or make it a relatively closed affair with your
hosting partner.  For your first one it might be nice to make it closed as you
can then ensure a quality audience.  Remember that you have the chance to
attract people who might not know anything about Free Software and who have
their own networks that could tap into other potential translators.  A mass
event has issues about quality which we address below.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#venue:

Venue
=====

Your choice of venue should consider the following:

- Is it easy to get to
- Do they have enough computers
- Do they have Internet access if you need it

Remember to put lots of signage up on the day so that people can actually find
the venue.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#preparation:

Preparation
===========

Work with you partner to arrange the venue, people, etc.  Make sure you have
actually seen the computer lab and tested how things will work.  If needed make
contact with the lab assistant, manager, whatever and get their buy-in.
They'll be a wonderful ally if things go wrong and you have brought them
on-board.

It is also nice to arrange refreshment, prizes and talks.  So plan for those
and get sponsors if needed.  And perhaps give a slot for people to talk on
various aspect of Free Software and translation.  Talks and refreshments give a
nice break for people to network and get excited.

Ensure that you have a team of helpers that can assist newbies during
translation, the number depends on the number of people expected.  The ideal
people are more computer focused then language focused.  You need people who
can quickly tell if something is a brand name, explain a computer term,
describe what something does or how a term is used in computers.  Having
language specialists on hand is useful as they can direct the language aspect
of the same word choice problems.

Choose a date so that the majority of people are available.  Avoid the obvious
like school holidays.  Public holidays may actually be a good time to host the
event unless they are family-oriented holidays or long weekends.  If you want
to attract students at University make it fall into their program, avoid exam
times, holidays, etc.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#what_should_you_translate:

What should you translate?
==========================

Ultimately the choice should align with broader goals for the language team.
If this is the initial translation then you might want to translate a glossary,
especially if you have access to language experts.

Another thing to consider is that if people have something to show for it
afterwards then it is more rewarding.  So translating the Mozilla web-browser
and actually completing it so that people could take it home or download it
shortly after the event.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#a_few_days_before:

A few days before
=================

Remind people of the event and check the computers.  Nothing is worse than no
one coming or the computers not working.  Check that you actually have access
to the lab and its not closed for some obscure reason.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#on_the_day:

On the day
==========

Arrange for yourself and helpers to arrive early.  Check that the catering is
OK.  Recheck the computers.  Welcome people.

Take it as it goes and adjust your program if it isn't working.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#program:

Program

This is the suggested program that we use.

15:00                                                                   Tea

======================================================================  ===============================================================

This gives you 4 hours of translation time with none more than an hour long.
Adjust as needed.  If you have a mixture of new and experienced translators
then it might be nice to arrange the venue so that experienced translators
don't have to listen to any of the talks.

Give people a copy of the program and include the titles of the talks.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#event_close:

Event close
===========

Don't forget to thank people.  It is also good to get participants to fill out
an evaluation form as this allows people to give feedback.  You can also use it
to recruite people to the mailing lists and to help organise your next event.

Here is an :doc:`example evaluation form
<translateathon-evaluation_form.odt>`

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#post_translate@thon_followup:

Post translate@thon followup
============================

Keep the energy going.  Some ideas for this are to establish a mailing list.
Send out copies of what was translated.  Give prizes to those who did the most,
had the least errors, made the funniest mistake.  Share stories about errors
that were funny.

.. _../pages/guide/translateathon#quality:

Quality
=======

How do you ensure quality of the work?  These are people who have just started
software translation and thus their work will be suspect, take that for
granted.  There are a few things you can do to increase quality.

* Ensure that people are well informed about common mistakes
* Have a document that gives a guideline to translators. The document should
  also identify things like variables, how to choose words, etc.
* Talk to new people before they start, have a quick 15 minute translation
  session then talk again to reiterate the issues.
* Never accept translations from a translate-athon until they have been
  reviewed by an established translator.  If needed add them to the PO files
  but mark all of them fuzzy.
* Optionally only use professional language people: lecturers, translators
* Have computer people on hand to answer questions, or make technical and
  language people work in pairs.
* Encourage people to ask questions, regularly and often.  This is important as
  some culture see asking questions as an indication of a lack of knowledge, be
  very concerned if nobody is asking questions.
* Plan for review, quality assurance and testing as part of the event schedule.
  The quality checks in Pootle is a great way to get everybody involved in
  reviewing the translations. The search feature might help to review
  terminology. Obviously getting the translated program running is good for
  reviewing things in context.
* For consistency at large events, it is probably worthwhile to prepare a
  terminology list before the event and install that in Pootle for
  :ref:`terminology suggestions <pootle:features/terminology>`. This will at
  least eliminate certain types of inconsistencies. :ref:`Translation memory
  <pootle:updatetm>` is another way to help, although that might be harder to
  setup, depending on the administration skills available.
