Tortoise CVS
************

This is a Windows based application for using the CVS version control system.
CVS is used by many localisation projects and eventually you will probably need
to interact with it.

It is also useful if you can localise but only on a Windows based machine at
work or University.  This way you can still contribute to FOSS localisation on
from your Windows machine.

See also :doc:`wincvs` as an alternative to Tortoise CVS.
